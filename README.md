## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your local development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL database (You can get one for free from [Supabase](https://supabase.com))

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mendableai/firegeo
cd firegeo
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your API keys and secrets.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

You'll need to edit `.env.local` to add your keys. See the **Configuration** section below for a detailed list of all variables. The most important ones to start are `DATABASE_URL` and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.

To generate a `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, run:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 3. Automated Setup

Run the automated setup script. This will install dependencies, connect to your database, and run all necessary migrations and initializations.

```bash
npm run setup
```

The script will guide you through the process and let you know if any required keys are missing.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application is now running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works (Architecture)

FireGEO is built on a modern, decoupled architecture that is easy to extend.

-   **Frontend:** A Next.js 15 application using React 19 and Tailwind CSS for styling. All UI components are located in the `components/` directory.
-   **Backend:** Next.js API Routes handle all backend logic. These are found in `app/api/`. The backend is responsible for communicating with the database and external services.
-   **Database:** A PostgreSQL database with a schema managed by Drizzle ORM. The schema is defined in `lib/db/schema.ts`.
-   **Authentication:** Handled by `better-auth`, which provides a secure, cookie-based authentication system.
-   **Billing:** `autumn-js` integrates with the Autumn API, which acts as a billing layer on top of Stripe. This decouples your app from Stripe's complexities.
-   **AI & Scraping:** The application communicates with external APIs like Firecrawl and various AI providers to power its core features. API clients and wrappers are in the `lib/` directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

This section details how to get the necessary API keys and set up the required services.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required for |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string. | **Core** |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Secure secret for auth. | **Core** |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public URL of your app. | **Core** |
| `AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY` | API key from Autumn for billing. | **Billing** |
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | API key from Firecrawl for scraping. | **Brand Monitor** |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | API key from Resend for emails. | **Emails** |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | "From" address for sending emails. | **Emails** |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key. | **AI Chat/Brand Monitor** |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`| Anthropic API key. | **AI Chat/Brand Monitor** |
| `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`| Perplexity API key. | **AI Chat/Brand Monitor** |
| `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key. | **AI Chat/Brand Monitor** |

### Service Setup

#### 1. Database (PostgreSQL)
- Create a free PostgreSQL database at [Supabase](https://supabase.com).
- Go to **Settings ‚Üí Database**.
- Copy the **connection string** (URI) and paste it as your `DATABASE_URL`.

#### 2. Billing (Autumn)
Autumn simplifies Stripe integration for SaaS billing.
1.  **Sign up** at [useautumn.com](https://useautumn.com).
2.  **Get API Key:** In your Autumn dashboard, go to **Settings ‚Üí Developer** and create an API key. Add it as `AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY`.
3.  **Connect Stripe:** Go to **Integrations ‚Üí Stripe** and connect your Stripe account.
4.  **Create Features & Products:** The `npm run setup` script can do this for you automatically if you provide your `AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY`. If you want to do it manually, create a "Usage" feature with ID `messages` and products that use this feature.

#### 3. AI & Scraping Providers
- **Firecrawl:** Get your API key from [app.firecrawl.dev](https://app.firecrawl.dev/api-keys).
- **AI Providers:** Get keys from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys), [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), and [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api).

## üìú Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Starts the development server with Turbopack. |
| `npm run build` | Builds the application for production. |
| `npm run start` | Starts the production server. |
| `npm run lint` | Lints the codebase. |
| `npm run setup` | Runs the automated setup wizard. |
| `npm run db:push` | Pushes the Drizzle schema to the database. |
| `npm run db:studio` | Opens the Drizzle Studio GUI to view your data. |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Creates and runs database migrations. |

## Production Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy is to use Vercel.

```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Configuration
1.  Add all your `.env.local` variables to your Vercel project's environment variables.
2.  Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your production domain.
3.  Ensure `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`.

After deploying, you may need to run database migrations if you've made schema changes:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Error: "relation 'user' does not exist"
If you see this error, Better Auth tables haven't been created. Run:
```bash
# Generate Better Auth schema
npx @better-auth/cli generate --config better-auth.config.ts

# Push the schema to database
npm run db:push
```

### Common Issues

- **Auth Issues**: Ensure `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is set and matches between deploys
- **Database Errors**: Run `npm run db:push` to sync schema
- **Billing Issues**: Check Autumn products are created with correct IDs
- **Email Failures**: Verify Resend domain and `EMAIL_FROM` address
- **Brand Monitor**: Ensure `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is valid
