## Accessing Your Dashboard

The **Dashboard** is your central hub for managing everything related to your account. You can typically access it by clicking on your profile icon or a "Dashboard" link in the main navigation menu after you have logged in.

## Managing Your Profile & Settings

### Editing Your Profile

The "Profile Information" section at the top of the dashboard displays your account details.

1.  To make changes, click the **"Edit Profile"** button.
2.  The fields for your Display Name, Phone, and Bio will become editable.
3.  Make your desired changes and click **"Save"**. To discard changes, click **"Cancel"**.

Your email address is tied to your account and cannot be changed from this screen.

### Notification Settings

In the "Settings" section, you can control the emails you receive from us:

-   **Email Notifications:** These are transactional emails related to your account activity (e.g., billing alerts, security notices).
-   **Marketing Emails:** These are promotional emails about new features, offers, and news.

Toggle the switch next to each setting to enable or disable it.

## Managing Your Subscription

### Viewing Available Plans

You can view all available subscription plans in two places:
1.  **Public Pricing Page:** If you are logged out, the "Pricing" link will show you all available plans.
2.  **Dashboard:** The "Available Plans" section on your dashboard shows all tiers.

### How to Upgrade or Downgrade Your Plan

You can change your current subscription directly from the dashboard.

1.  In the "Available Plans" section, find the plan you wish to switch to.
2.  Click the **"Upgrade"** or **"Downgrade"** button on the right.
3.  A dialog box will appear, summarizing the changes and detailing the new billing terms.
4.  Follow the prompts to confirm the change. The new plan may take effect immediately or at the end of your current billing cycle, as indicated in the confirmation dialog.

### Viewing Your Current Plan

Your active subscription is clearly marked with a **"Current Plan"** label in the "Available Plans" section of your dashboard. If you have scheduled a change, it will be marked with a **"Scheduled"** label, indicating the date the new plan will become active.

## Monitoring Usage Statistics

The "Usage Statistics" section gives you a real-time overview of your credit consumption for the current billing period.

-   **Usage Bars:** For each feature (like "Messages" or "Brand Analysis Credits"), you can see a progress bar showing how much of your monthly allowance you have used.
-   **Reset Date:** The date when your usage will reset and your credits will be replenished is shown below the usage bars.

This section helps you stay informed about your consumption so you can decide if you need to upgrade your plan.
