## Understanding the Chat Interface

The AI Chat is divided into two main sections: a sidebar for managing your conversations and a main window for interacting with the AI.

### The Sidebar: Your Conversation Hub

The sidebar on the left is where all your chat history is stored and managed.

- **New Chat Button:** Located at the top, this button allows you to start a fresh conversation with the AI.
- **Conversation List:** Below the "New Chat" button, you'll find a list of all your past conversations. Each item shows a title and the time of the last message, making it easy to find previous chats.
- **Messages Remaining:** At the bottom of the sidebar, you can see a real-time count of your available message credits.

You can hide or show the sidebar by clicking the **Menu/X** icon in the top-left corner of the main chat window.

### The Main Chat Window

This is where you'll have your conversations with the AI.

- **Header:** Displays the title of the currently selected conversation.
- **Message Area:** Shows the back-and-forth dialogue between you and the AI. Your messages appear on the right in orange, and the AI's responses appear on the left in gray.
- **Input Field:** At the very bottom, you'll find the text box where you can type your message.

## How to Use the Chat

### Starting a New Chat

To start a new conversation, simply click the **"+ New Chat"** button at the top of the sidebar. The chat window will clear, allowing you to begin a new topic with the AI.

### Sending a Message

1.  Type your message into the input field at the bottom of the chat window.
2.  Press **Enter** or click the **Send** button.

Your message will be sent to the AI, and you will see a "thinking" animation while the AI processes your request. The response will appear in the chat window shortly after.

### Switching Between Conversations

All your past chats are saved in the sidebar. To revisit an older conversation, simply click on it in the list. The chat window will load the full history of that conversation.

### Deleting a Conversation

If you no longer need a conversation, you can delete it:
1.  Hover over the conversation you wish to remove in the sidebar.
2.  Click the **trash can icon** that appears on the right.
3.  A confirmation dialog will pop up. Click **"Delete"** to permanently remove the conversation.

## The Messaging Credit System

The AI Chat operates on a credit-based system.

### How Credits Work

- Each message you send to the AI consumes one or more credits from your account.
- Your remaining message credits are displayed at the bottom of the sidebar.
- Different subscription plans come with a different number of monthly message credits.

### What Happens When You Run Out?

If your message credit balance reaches zero, the message input field will become disabled. You will not be able to send any more messages until your credits are replenished.

A message will appear in the chat window prompting you to upgrade your plan to get more credits. You can click the **"Get More Credits"** button to view the available subscription plans.
