## How Credits Work

Credits are the internal currency of the application. Each action consumes a certain number of credits depending on its complexity and the resources required.

## Cost per Operation

### Brand Monitor

## Optimization Tips

### Reduce Consumption

1. **Disable web search** if you don’t need it — saves 50% of credits per analysis
2. **Limit the number of prompts** to those most relevant to your analysis
3. **Reuse recent analyses** instead of launching new ones

### Consumption Examples

**Example of a complete brand analysis:**

* URL Analysis: 1 credit
* Search for 5 competitors: 2 credits
* Generation of 10 prompts: 2 credits
* Analysis of 10 prompts without web: 10 credits
* **Total: 15 credits**

**Example of an in-depth analysis with web search:**

* URL Analysis: 1 credit
* Search for 5 competitors: 2 credits
* Generation of 10 prompts: 2 credits
* Analysis of 10 prompts with web: 20 credits
* **Total: 25 credits**

## Tracking Your Consumption
