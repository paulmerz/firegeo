## Getting Started: Your First Analysis

The Brand Monitor guides you through a step-by-step process to set up and run a comprehensive analysis.

### Step 1: Enter Your Website URL

To begin, simply enter your company's primary website URL into the input field and click **"Analyze"**.

- **What happens now?** The system will scrape your website to gather basic information about your company, such as its name, description, and industry. This process is powered by Firecrawl and is essential for creating a baseline for the AI analysis.
- **Credit Cost:** This initial scrape costs a small number of credits. You will be notified of the cost before proceeding.

### Step 2: Review Your Company Profile

Once the initial scrape is complete, a **Company Card** will appear with the information gathered from your website. Review these details to ensure they are accurate.

From here, you can proceed to identify your competitors.

### Step 3: Identify Competitors

After reviewing your company profile, click **"Find Competitors"**.

- **How it works:** The system uses an intelligent search process to automatically identify a list of your top competitors based on your company's profile.
- **Managing the list:** You can remove any suggested competitors that are not relevant or manually add new ones if you know of a competitor that wasn't found.
- **Credit Cost:** This step also requires credits to run the competitor identification process.

Once you are satisfied with the competitor list, click **"Continue to Analysis"**.

### Step 4: Configure and Run the Analysis

This is the final step before launching the full analysis. Here you can:

1.  **Review the Prompts:** The system generates a series of analytical prompts that will be sent to various AI models. You can review these prompts, remove any that are not relevant, or add your own custom prompts.
2.  **Enable Web Search (Recommended):** You have the option to toggle **"Web Search"** on or off. When enabled, the AI models can access the internet for the most up-to-date information, leading to a more accurate and comprehensive analysis.
3.  **Start the Analysis:** Click the **"Start Analysis"** button to begin.

The system will now query multiple AI providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) using the configured prompts. You can watch the progress in real-time as the results come in.

## Understanding the Results Dashboard

Once the analysis is complete, you will be presented with a detailed dashboard. Use the sidebar to navigate between the different results tabs.

### Navigation Sidebar

- **Restart:** Clears the current results and takes you back to the beginning to start a new analysis.
- **Tabs:** Switch between `Visibility`, `Matrix`, `Rankings`, `Prompts`, and `Sources`.

### Visibility Score

This tab provides a high-level overview of your brand's online visibility compared to your competitors. It includes key metrics like:

- **Overall Visibility Score:** A percentage score representing your brand's presence.
- **Share of Voice:** How often your brand is mentioned compared to competitors.
- **Average Position:** Your brand's average ranking across different AI provider responses.

### Comparison Matrix

The matrix provides a detailed, side-by-side comparison of how different AI providers perceive your brand versus your competitors. It helps you understand:

- **Strengths and Weaknesses:** Identify where your brand is strong or weak according to the AIs.
- **Provider Bias:** See if certain AI models favor your brand or your competitors.

### Provider Rankings

This tab breaks down the analysis by each individual AI provider. You can see:

- **Who ranks first?** For each provider, see a ranked list of your brand and your competitors.
- **Detailed sentiment analysis:** Understand the tone and context of the AI's perception.

### Prompts & Responses

Here you can review the exact questions (prompts) that were sent to the AI models and see their detailed responses. This is useful for:

- **Deep-dive analysis:** Understand the reasoning behind the scores and rankings.
- **Content ideas:** Use the AI responses to generate ideas for marketing copy, blog posts, and more.

### Sources

If "Web Search" was enabled, this tab lists the web pages and sources that the AI models used to inform their responses. This is only available on certain subscription plans.

## Managing Your Analyses

The Brand Monitor keeps a history of all your past analyses, allowing you to track your progress over time.

### Starting a New Analysis

Click the **"New Analysis"** button in the top-left sidebar to begin a new analysis from scratch.

### Viewing Past Analyses

Your past analyses are listed in the left-hand sidebar. Simply click on one to load the results into the dashboard. Each analysis is saved with the date it was run.

### Deleting an Analysis

To delete a past analysis, hover over it in the sidebar and click the **trash can icon**. You will be asked to confirm the deletion.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How are credits used?

Credits are used to pay for the different stages of the analysis process:
- **URL Scraping:** A small, one-time cost to analyze your website.
- **Competitor Identification:** A cost to run the intelligent search for competitors.
- **Prompt Analysis:** A cost per prompt, which varies depending on whether "Web Search" is enabled.

You will always be notified of the credit cost before proceeding with a paid action.

### What is "Web Search"?

"Web Search" allows the AI models to perform live searches on the internet to gather the most current information for their analysis. Disabling it means the AIs will only use their pre-existing knowledge, which may be outdated. We highly recommend keeping it enabled for the best results.

### Why are some tabs or features disabled?

Access to certain features, like the **Sources tab** or the ability to view web search results, may depend on your subscription plan. If you are on a "Free" or "Starter" plan, these features might be hidden or disabled. Check your plan details for more information.
