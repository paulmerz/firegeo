## Writing prompts that perform

Well‑crafted prompts guide AI models toward actionable answers: they mirror how your customers search while giving enough context to compare brands. Aim to stay close to what a real user would ask to avoid overly long‑tail scenarios that AIs struggle to answer.

### 1. Start from a credible user intent
* Rephrase the question as if typed into a search engine or asked to an assistant ("Which solution…", "What are the best…").
* Limit to one problem per prompt: one prompt = one clear need.
* Draw from personas, current campaigns, or recurring support questions.

**Examples**
* ✅ `Which brand monitoring solution fits B2B SMBs?`
* ✅ `What are the best Voxum alternatives to monitor online reputation?`
* ❌ `Exhaustive comparison of AI marketing suites for European CAC40 SaaS healthcare companies` (too long/rare; the model lacks signal).

### 2. Provide sufficient business context
* Mention company type, product/service category, and, if needed, geography.
* Add the primary use case or criterion (e.g., budget, speed, compliance) to steer the AI to the right arguments.
* Cite a few major competitors only if you want to test their coverage.

**Typical structure**: `Which + product category + for + segment or use case + (optional: key constraint)`

### 3. Use a natural yet precise tone
* Prefer common terms ("tool", "platform", "agency") over internal jargon.
* Avoid stacking too many keywords/abbreviations; it looks like artificial SEO and yields noisy answers.
* Ensure the sentence reads smoothly out loud.

### 4. Leverage Voxum options
* **Scope**: specify country/region, company size, or vertical to focus the search.
* **Web search**: enable when you need very recent information (the UI will then display sources).
* **Dynamic prompts**: combine in‑house prompts with automatically suggested ones to cover core market and relevant niches.

### 5. Build a balanced set
* Four to six prompts are enough for a solid panorama: two “generic” questions (broad comparison), two focused on a key segment, and one oriented around a differentiator (price, innovation, integrations, etc.).
* Include one defensive question ("Why is [brand] recommended for…?") to measure share of voice on your core benefits.
* Revisit prompts regularly: refresh after product launches, new targets, or major campaigns.

### 6. Segment with the GEO method
To keep analyses clear (one topic per report), tag each prompt with a structured label set. One analysis = one primary GEO tag.

**A. Market context** – Where is the speaker?
* Geography: Local / Regional / National / International
* Segment: B2B / B2C / B2B2C / Enterprise / SMB
* Demographic angle: Student / Professional / Executive / Family / Consumer
* Example tag: `[Market: B2B, International, SMB]`

**B. Topic category** – What is the prompt really about?
* Product (features, usage, performance)
* Service (support, delivery, onboarding)
* Price & value (costs, ROI, promotions)
* Reputation (reviews, trust, comparisons)
* Ethics & brand (sustainability, inclusion, social impact)
* Competitors (direct or indirect mentions)
* Example tag: `[Topic: Price & Value]`

**C. Use case / intent** – What action is implied?
* Discovery: "What does your tool do?"
* Comparison: "Why choose you over X?"
* Purchase: "How to buy?"
* Support: "I can’t log in"
* Renewal: "What’s the price of the new plan?"
* Defense/advocacy: "I recommended your product"
* Example tag: `[Use Case: Comparison]`

**D. Sentiment and tone** – How does the person speak?
* Positive (enthusiasm, loyalty)
* Neutral (factual, curious)
* Negative (complaint, doubt, frustration)
* Mixed (praise + criticism)
* Optional: emotional flavor (urgent, skeptical, sarcastic...)
* Example tag: `[Sentiment: Negative, Skeptical]`

**E. Brand association** – With whom is it compared?
* Only your brand
* Named competitor (explicit mention)
* Generic category ("AI tools")
* Cross‑industry analogy ("like Amazon for logistics")
* Example tag: `[Association: Competitor – Brand X]`

### Recommended workflow for teams
1. **Collect prompts**: extract questions from support tickets, sales calls, chats, or social.
2. **Tag with GEO dimensions**: attach at least three tags (Market, Topic, Use Case). Add Sentiment and Association if available.
3. **Cluster**: group recurring prompts (e.g., all price complaints, B2B SMB Negative).
4. **Run AI analysis**: create one analysis per cluster and measure frequency, tone, and competitive positioning.
5. **Operationalize**: keep tags to track perception over time and feed product, marketing, and CX roadmaps.

### Quick checklist before launching
* Does the intent feel natural for a prospect?
* Is the prompt focused on a single, clear need?
* Is market/segment context sufficient?
* Do we cover both generic queries and differentiators?
* Is the wording concise (single sentence) and free of internal jargon?

By applying these principles, you’ll get consistent answers that are easy to compare across AI providers and directly actionable for marketing.
